Various code coverage scripts, originally used for the Mozilla (browser) project by Joshua Cranmer.
Forked from https://github.com/jcranmer/mozilla-coverage, since that project is no longer maintained.
The Python scripts rely on lcov and d3.js to produce colored tables and treemaps to illustrate code coverage.
